# Kvasir2 - Constexpr Version of Kvasir Register library

Currently there exists in the works a library for handling the reading/writing of IO registers on a micro controller: https://github.com/kvasir-io/Kvasir

As far as I understand it, its release is pending the release of another library, which is to speed up TMP.

This libraries goal is to do the same thing as Kvasir, except without the TMP, so it compiles faster......that is the goal
